{"name":"Pset-3","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome Back to Smart Challenge!\r\nWe’re a group of anonymous 12th graders from SKCH. And we will continue giving people this opportunity to hone their problem solving and logic skills in a fun way.\r\nThe responses to the last two sets were simply superb. We had students of all classes answering and finding novel and creative ways to solve each problem.\r\nWe're expecting an even more enthusiastic response this time .\r\nWe have included problems of different types-each requiring different thinking so as to give you this experience. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\n+ Solutions can be sent to smartchallengeskch@gmail.com \r\n+ Solutions without justification will not be accepted.\r\n+ This sheet will be removed two weeks after posting.\r\n+ Answers will be posted physically and online at the link given above.\r\n\r\n### Problem Set - 3\r\n\r\n#####Problem 3.1.Caesar Cipher\r\n\r\n* A Caesar cipher is a simple and easily crackable encryption method. The approach is to replace each letter of the secret message with a different letter of the alphabet which is ‘n’ positions further in the alphabet.\r\n* Eg.if n=3 “This is a cipher” becomes “Wklv lv d flskhu”\r\n* Since each letter in the message can directly be translated to another letter, you can use frequency of letters to decipher the code.\r\n* A more straightforward approach to crack a caesar cipher would be to try all values of n(1-25) and see what results.\r\n* How would you crack “Cqn zdrlt kaxfw oxg sdvyb xena cqn ujih mxp ” ?\r\n* What is n in this case?\r\n* Note: If letters exceed ‘z’ they are made to rotate back to ‘a’. \r\n       Each word in the original message is a valid word in English.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#####Problem 3.2.  N factors\r\n* Given a number N how would you find the smallest integer which has at least N factors (1 and the number included)?\r\n- i)N=36\r\n- ii)N=72\r\n* Hint: Use your computer’s help.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solutions\r\nSend in your solutions to smartchallengeskch@gmail.com\r\nSolutions will be updated in the github repository.
